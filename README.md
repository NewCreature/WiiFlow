# WiiFlow
Open source Wii GUI USB Loader

My own modified version of WiiFlow which fixes issues I have with it.

Things that have been fixed:

* Fixed makefiles so they work under MacOS X.
* Fix issue where games configured to force 4:3 aspect ratio wouldn't respect that setting on Wii U.

Things I would like to implement:

* Modify interface to make it more kid-friendly. Currently, it's way too easy for a child to mess things up. The settings and ability to delete games should be hidden away under normal circumstances and those types of functions should be able to be blocked with a password.
